# Distributed Systems & Resilience

Koda Zenith is designed for industrial scale. By adopting the semantics of the BEAM (Erlang VM), we provide a foundation that allows for massive concurrency and "Let it Crash" reliability within the Bun/Deno ecosystem.

## The Actor Model Convergence

In Zenith, every request or background task is treated as an isolated "Actor". These actors do not share memory; they communicate via asynchronous message passing.

- **Process Isolation**: A failure in one actor cannot bring down the entire system.
- **Self-Healing Supervision**: Actors are monitored by "Supervisors" that automatically restart failed processes.
- **Massive Concurrency**: Handle millions of lightweight processes with minimal memory overhead.

## Horizon Synchronization

Koda Zenith uses a proprietary protocol called **Horizon** to synchronize state across global clusters with sub-50ms consistency.

```typescript
import { spawn, receive, send } from '@koda/beam';

// Spawn a resilient actor
const pid = spawn(() => {
  receive(msg => {
    switch(msg.type) {
      case 'SYNC_STATE':
        return performSync(msg.payload);
      case 'CLUSTER_UP':
        return log('Node joined cluster');
    }
  });
});

// Send message to the local or remote process
send(pid, { type: 'SYNC_STATE', payload: data });
```

## Fault Tolerance at Scale

We don't try to prevent every error. We build systems that can recover from them. Zenith's built-in monitoring provides real-time heatmaps of actor health, allowing you to identify bottlenecks and failure points before they impact users.

## Location Transparency

The Horizon protocol makes it irrelevant where a process is running. You can send a message to a process on a server in Tokyo from a server in London using the exact same syntax as a local call.
