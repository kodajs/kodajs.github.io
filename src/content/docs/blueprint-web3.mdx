# Web3 Native Infrastructure

Koda Zenith treats the blockchain as a first-class citizen of the runtime. We have built an integrated environment where smart contracts and backend logic share the same security posture and performance characteristics.

## Integrated Smart Contracts

Forget the complex toolchains of the past. With Koda Zenith, you write your smart contracts directly within your project structure using Rust or Zig.

### The Zenith-Local Network

For development, Zenith spins up a high-performance local ledger that mimics the target production environment (EVM, Solana, or Zenith-Mainnet) with zero latency.

## Direct Contract Embedding

By using Tagged Templates, you can define contract structures that are compiled into optimized WASM byte-code during the standard `build` process.

```typescript
import { contract } from '@koda/web3';

/**
 * Define a high-performance vault contract in Rust
 * This is compiled to WASM and deployed automatically
 */
export const Vault = contract.rust`
  #[koda::contract]
  pub struct Vault {
      balance: Map<Address, u256>,
      owner: Address,
  }

  impl Vault {
      pub fn deposit(&mut self, amount: u256) {
          let caller = koda::msg::sender();
          let current = self.balance.get(caller).unwrap_or(0);
          self.balance.insert(caller, current + amount);
      }
  }
`;
```

## Security & Auditability

The Koda compiler performs static analysis on your contracts to detect common vulnerabilities before they reach the chain:
- **Integer Overflow Protection**
- **Reentrancy Guard Injection**
- **Formal Verification Hints**

## Multi-Chain Orchestration

Zenith acts as a powerful orchestrator, allowing you to manage state across multiple chains simultaneously from a single unified API. No more juggling different libraries for different networks.
