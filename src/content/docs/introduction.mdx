# Introduction to Koda Zenith

**Koda Zenith** is not just a framework; it's a declaration of intent. We built Zenith to eliminate the boilerplate, latency, and cognitive load that plagues modern web development.

## The Problem

Traditional backends are:
- **Slow**: Interpreted at runtime.
- **Bloated**: Dependencies on dependencies.
- **Fragile**: Type safety is an afterthought.

## The Zenith Solution

We compiled the backend. By leveraging the power of **Zig**, **Rust**, and **Elixir semantics**, Koda Zenith provides a native-first environment for the post-web era.

### Core Pillars

1. **[Native Bridges](/docs/native-bridges)**: Zero-copy integration with Zig and Rust.
2. **[AI & Inference](/docs/blueprint-ai)**: GPU-accelerated computing without Python.
3. **[Web3 Native](/docs/blueprint-web3)**: Smart contracts embedded in the stack.
4. **[Massive Scale](/docs/blueprint-distributed)**: Actor-model concurrency for millions of connections.
5. **[Spatial UI](/docs/blueprint-spatial)**: Immersive interfaces for the AR/VR world.

## Getting Started

To initialize a new Koda Zenith project:

```bash
bun create koda my-app
```
